IMPORTANT!!!!

please note that for the sake of storage, the public folder was not included 
in the forRender folder, which is the deployment version of the website.
You can simply copy and paste it from the myWebsite folder.
Either case, it would not make a difference for the deployment 
of the website since it was deployed with the public folder.
I would've just liked to make this point clear
